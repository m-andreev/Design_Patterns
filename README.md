# Abstract Factory Method

The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It's particularly useful when your code needs to work with multiple types of related objects, and you want to ensure that the created objects are compatible with each other.


In this example:

We define abstract product classes Button, Checkbox, and TextField representing GUI elements.

We define an abstract factory interface GUIFactory with methods for creating these GUI elements.

Concrete product classes (WindowsButton, WindowsCheckbox, etc.) represent Windows theme GUI elements, and corresponding concrete factories (WindowsFactory) implement the GUIFactory interface for Windows theme.

Similarly, there are concrete product classes (MacOSButton, MacOSCheckbox, etc.) for macOS theme and a corresponding factory (MacOSFactory).

The renderUI function accepts a factory and creates GUI elements. It demonstrates how you can render consistent GUI elements for a specific theme without worrying about their concrete implementations.

In the main function, we create GUI elements for both Windows and macOS themes and render them accordingly.
